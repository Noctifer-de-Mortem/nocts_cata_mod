msgid "This is an ARC rifle modified into something resembling a double-barrel shotgun.  It fires short-range EMP pulses; still decent against conventional threats but best against electronics.  The manufacturer is listed as Omnitech Labs.  This one has been converted to use a UPS, a modification to allow sustained operations in the field in case resupply is not available."
