Expansion mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

*WARNING*!!!: This mod requires the experimental builds for it to work.

This is the gigantic jabberwock of a mod that adds a lot of content to the game. It adds new items, buildings, scenarios, monsters, etc. It also reworks and adds alternatives to many things from recipes to scenarios. It also adds a pseudo-story and lore on the works.

The **Bio-Weapon**, **Super Soldier**, **Commandeer**, **Slave Fighters** and the **Old World Prepper** NPC factions join the world.

Seek the Bio-weapons, find loot, take down news monsters and invest in skills for new craftable items.

Good luck, Survivor!
