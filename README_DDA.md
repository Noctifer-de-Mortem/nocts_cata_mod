# Expansion mod for Cataclysm, Dark Days Ahead version

The version of this mod in this folder is is for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. Copy the folder containing this content into data/mods if you are using that version of Cataclysm. Use the other folder, nocts_cata_mod_BN if you are playing with Cataclysm: Bright Nights.

This is the gigantic jabberwock of a mod that adds a lot of content to the game. It adds new items, buildings, scenarios, monsters, etc. It also reworks and adds alternatives to many things from recipes to scenarios. It also adds a pseudo-story and lore on the works.

The **Bio-Weapon**, **Super Soldier**, **Commandeers**, **Slave Fighters** and the **Old World Prepper** NPC factions join the world.

Seek the Bio-weapons, find loot, take down new monsters and invest in skills for new craftable items.

Good luck, Survivor!

## Contributing
So you want to contribute to the game? Good to hear! Here is the general guideline.

#### Suggestions
If you want to add a suggestion, you can post it as an issue at [Github](https://github.com/Noctifer-de-Mortem/nocts_cata_mod/issues) or in the [forum.](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/cataclysm-mod/10523)

Suggestions can be anything that can be able to be done by messing with the JSON file and that does not go against the devs general wishes. If you don't know if your suggestion meets that criteria, ask anyway and we will let you know.

#### Reporting bugs
Bugs can be reported as a Github issue or in the mod's forum thread. Please provide the build your are using and the version of the mod. If it is an issue with the game and not the mod, then the issue will be forwarded to the game.

#### Modifying the code
You can do with this mod whatever you want. You can altered it, distribute it, start your own mod with it, etc. But if you wish to contribute to add to the mod itself, you can do so through Github. Just make a PR with your changes and someone with the correct permissions will review it and either accept it or reject it. Bug fixes and rebalances will rarely get rejected but new things might.

#### Github Rules
For starters, go to the issues page and if you would like to work on a specific issue, assign it to yourself. This way we can keep track of who is working on what. If you want PR something that has nothing to do with any issue, just make the PR and await review. Milestone will be made to have a goal to work towards; if you have the skill to work towards one, go for it. Before making a PR, make a world using the latest game experimental and only this mod and see if everything works, if it does, make the PR.
